# redo
yet another sample react+redux app for reference/forkage.

similar to the todo list app from the egghead [idiomatic redux tutorial](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux) -- but updated to be compatible with [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) v4's api as well as [normalizr](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr) v3; plus a few changes & features

at various points this has used code from
- [the boy dan abramov's getting started with redux tut](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)
- [the aforementioned idiomatic redux course](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux)
- [idiomatic redux course notes](https://github.com/tayiorbeii/egghead.io_idiomatic_redux_course_notes)
- [redux docs](http://redux.js.org/)
