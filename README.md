# redo
yet another sample react+redux app for reference/forkage.

similar to the todo list app from the egghead idiomatic redux tutorial -- but updated to be compatible with react-router v4's api as well as normalizer v3; plus a few changes & features

at various points this has used code from
- [the boy dan abramov's getting started with redux tut](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)
- [dan's idiomatic redux course](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux)
- [idiomatic redux course notes](https://github.com/tayiorbeii/egghead.io_idiomatic_redux_course_notes)
- [redux docs](http://redux.js.org/)
